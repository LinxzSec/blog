Hey, my name is Linxz. I am a vulnerability researcher who is primarily interested in hypervisor technology and kernel security. More recently I've been looking into exploit mitigations and occasionally I do some cryptography stuff.

If you'd like to contact me you can find my links below and at the bottom of the page. I'd prefer Twitter for non-urgent matters, if you require me for professional reasons please just ask for my email, thanks.
