Hey, my name is Linxz. I am a vulnerability researcher who is primarily interested in hypervisor technology and kernel security. More recently I've been looking into exploit mitigations and occasionally I do some cryptography stuff.

If you'd like to contact me you can find my links below and at the bottom of the page. I'd prefer Twitter for non-urgent matters, if you require me for professional reasons please just ask for my email, thanks.

???+ note
    If you're wondering why I've moved the blog to a new site generator the reason is that I no longer felt Hugo was sufficient for maintaining the level of quality & readability I want to achieve in my posts.

    In the past I myself have found reading blog posts about exploitation incredibly difficult not because the writer had done a bad job but because the way the content was generated was not suitable for such highly technical writing. I am hoping that the features of Material for MkDocs really help overcome this problem. Unfortunately as Material for MkDocs is not a blogging engine so to speak some features that exist in Hugo don't exist here. For instance categories have been completely replaced with tags and there's no longer a reading time indicator. Hopefully these are things which can be implemented back in with time.
